Hello,

I am Vetrivel Shanmugam. I am a developer based in Bangalore, India.

I started showing interests in open source project years back, the day I found codeceptJS tool. I was working in a project where we wrote E2E tests using it. I made a contribution to it which helped us to write tests with lesser code. 

Less code meant a lot of fun and I exercised with lot of ideas that can minimse coding task for business problems, computation problems and software problems but that wasn't the field I was in, so I showed interest in front end tools that generates code and then I found IBM rational rose. I took some design ideas from it and I moved forward in years, researched on tools that match our current trend, picked up ideas from several tools that had what I wanted. I put them all together and built ui-editor. It is a concept tool for front end web development, it can generate the code in reactJS. It started out as an experiment and now it has become my hobby. I am currently working on code generation for reactJS+redux.

I may have spent 2+ years building it and more than that to learn shortcuts, it was fun. I wanted to apply the things I learnt from ui-editor to AI. Like why not build a builder that helps to build neural networks by drawing on a canvas and fire it up? and more ideas started to show up. Spending time on frontend pays me, and investing time for AI is not ideal so I started writing instead of coding. I wrote some simple ideas, implementation designs to try with AI and it occured to me that ML and AI consumes 3-4 years of human brain, which wasn't a lot of fun. So I went for alternatives to mathematical model which was unrealistic and wrote unrealistic concepts such as neural fluid. The alternative to mathematical model is to go with microfluidics, apply it together with the power of light and I called it neural fluid. It is in very early stage and you can find about it in artificial-intelligence repo.  A fantasy in my mind is to build neural os pendrive, plug in to a computer and enjoy the show.
