Hello,

I am Vetrivel Shanmugam. I am a developer based in Bangalore, India.

I started showing interests in open source project years back, the day I found codeceptJS tool. I was working in a project where we wrote E2E tests using it. I made a contribution to it which helped us to write tests with lesser code. 

Less code meant a lot of fun and I exercised with lot of ideas that can minimse coding task for business problems, computation problems and software problems but that wasn't the field I was in, so I showed interest in front end tools that generates code and then I found IBM rational rose. I took some design ideas from it, I moved forward in years, researched on tools that match our current trend, picked up ideas from several tools that had what I wanted, I put them all together and built ui-editor. It is a concept tool for front end web development, it can generate the code in reactJS. It started out as an experiment and now it has become my hobby. I am currently working on code generation for reactJS+redux.
