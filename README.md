Hello,

I am Vetrivel Shanmugam. I am a developer based in Bangalore, India.

I started showing interests in open source project years back, the day I found **codeceptJS** tool. I was working in a project where we wrote E2E tests using it. I made a contribution to it which helped us to write tests with lesser code. 

**Less code is fun** and I exercised with lot of ideas that can minimse coding task for business problems, computation problems and software problems but that wasn't the field I was in, so I showed interest in front end tools that generates code and then I found IBM rational rose. I took some design ideas from it, I moved forward in years, researched on tools that match our current trend, picked up ideas from several tools that had what I wanted, I put them all together and built ui-editor. It is a concept tool for front end web development, it can **generate the code in reactJS**. It started out as an experiment and now it has become my hobby. I am currently working on a design tool within it, having code generation in place, it will be exciting to see a design being exported to code.

I have spent 2+ years building it and more than that to learn shortcuts, it was fun. I wanted to apply the things I learnt from ui-editor to AI. Like why not build a builder that helps to build neural networks by drawing on a canvas and fire it up? and more ideas started to show up. Spending time on frontend pays me, and investing time for AI is not ideal so I started writing instead of coding. I wrote some simple ideas, implementation designs to try with AI and it occured to me that ML and AI consumes 3-4 years of human brain, which isn't ideal. So I went for alternatives to mathematical model which was unrealistic and wrote **fictional concepts such as neural fluid, neural OS, light as fluid**. The alternative to mathematical model is to go with fluids, apply it together with the **power of light** and I called it neural fluid and an OS with neural fluid in it, I called it neural OS. The early notes about it can be found in my artificial-intelligence repository. A fantasy in my mind is to plug a neural os pendrive to a computer and enjoy the show.
  
From microfluids with light, I chipped away unwanted concepts from it and I have developed a technique to build an abstract concept called **Black Mass**, you can find about it, in below links.
